# choco-kustomize

This repository is the source for the packaging around the [Kustomize](https://kustomize.io/).

The source and releases for Kustomize are located on their [github page](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize).

If there are any issues please file them here. 
I will try to attend to them ASAP.

If a new version is needed, right now it's a manual update for me to support.
I will eventually be looking at automatic packaging in the near future.
